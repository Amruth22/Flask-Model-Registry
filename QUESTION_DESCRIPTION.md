# Model Registry - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Flask application demonstrating AI model registry with version control, automated deployment using multiple strategies (direct, blue-green, canary), rollback mechanisms with snapshot management, and performance tracking with alerting - all with SQLite persistence. This project teaches MLOps practices for AI model lifecycle management.

## Project Objectives

1. **Model Registry:** Build central registry for AI models with version management, metadata storage, model discovery, and version history tracking for organized model management.

2. **Version Control:** Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with version comparison, compatibility checking, latest version tracking, and version tagging for proper version management.

3. **Deployment Automation:** Create automated deployment system with multiple strategies - direct deployment for simplicity, blue-green for zero downtime, and canary for gradual rollout with health checks.

4. **Rollback Mechanisms:** Implement safe rollback system with automatic rollback on errors, manual rollback to specific versions, snapshot creation and restoration, and rollback history tracking.

5. **Performance Tracking:** Track model performance with latency monitoring, success rate tracking, token usage, version comparison, and alerting on performance degradation.

6. **Flask REST API:** Build REST API with endpoints for model registration, version management, deployment, rollback, and monitoring for external integration.
